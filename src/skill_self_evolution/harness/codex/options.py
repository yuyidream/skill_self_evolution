"""Codex SDK option building.

All Codex-specific construction logic lives here.

Key differences from Claude and OpenCode:
    - Codex uses `output_schema` directly (a plain JSON schema dict),
      not wrapped in {"type": "json_schema", "schema": ...} like OpenCode
    - Codex uses `working_directory` (not `cwd` like Claude/OpenCode)
    - Codex tools are built-in (file read/write, bash, etc.) — they can't
      be configured per-request like Claude's `allowed_tools`. We store
      the tools list as metadata so AgentTrace can report what was available.
    - No tool name mapping needed (unlike OpenCode which maps "Read" → "read")
    - No server/permission management needed (unlike OpenCode which manages
      a local HTTP server and writes opencode.json for file access)
    - Model names are passed directly ("gpt-5.1-codex-mini", "o3", "gpt-5")
      with no provider prefix (unlike OpenCode's "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6")

    """Build an options dict for the Codex SDK.

    This function has the same signature as build_claudecode_options() and
    build_opencode_options() — it's called by build_options() in utils.py
    when the active SDK is "codex". Agent profile factories never call this
    directly; they all go through build_options().

    Args:
        system: System prompt text (from the agent profile's prompt.txt or task.md)
        schema: JSON schema dict for structured output (from Pydantic model_json_schema())
        tools: Tool names from the agent profile (e.g., ["Read", "Write", "Bash"]).
               Stored as metadata only — Codex has its own built-in tools.
        project_root: Path to the project root. Resolved automatically if None.
        model: Codex model name (e.g., "gpt-5.1-codex-mini", "o3", "gpt-5").
               Defaults to DEFAULT_CODEX_MODEL if None.
        data_dirs: Extra data directories the agent should have access to.
                   If provided, their paths are appended to the system prompt
                   so the agent knows where to look.

    Returns:
        Dict with keys: system, output_schema, model, working_directory, tools, data_dirs.
        This dict is passed to execute_query() in executor.py.
