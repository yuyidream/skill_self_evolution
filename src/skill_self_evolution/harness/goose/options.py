"""Goose SDK option building.

All Goose-specific construction logic lives here.

Key differences from Claude, OpenCode, and Codex:
    - Goose is subprocess-based — no Python SDK to import
    - Model is specified as 'provider/model' (e.g., 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6')
      and split into separate GOOSE_PROVIDER and GOOSE_MODEL env vars
    - A recipe YAML is written to a temp file and passed to goose CLI at runtime
    - Tools are stored as metadata only — Goose has its own built-in toolset
    - No persistent server to manage (unlike OpenCode)

    """Build an options dict for the Goose harness.

    This function has the same signature as build_claudecode_options(),
    build_opencode_options(), and build_codex_options() — it is called by
    build_options() in utils.py when the active SDK is "goose". Agent
    profile factories never call this directly; they all go through
    build_options().

    Args:
        system: System prompt text (from the agent profile's prompt.txt or task.md)
        schema: JSON schema dict for structured output (from Pydantic model_json_schema())
        tools: Tool names from the agent profile (e.g., ["Read", "Write", "Bash"]).
               Stored as metadata only — Goose has its own built-in tools.
        project_root: Path to the project root. Resolved automatically if None.
        model: Model string, optionally prefixed with 'provider/'.
               Defaults to 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6' if None.
        data_dirs: Extra data directories the agent should have access to.
                   If provided, their paths are appended to the system prompt
                   so the agent knows where to look.

    Returns:
        Dict with keys: system, output_schema, provider, model, working_directory,
        tools, data_dirs. This dict is passed to execute_query() in executor.py.
